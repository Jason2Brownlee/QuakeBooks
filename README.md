## About

The goal of this project is to identify all books on or that cover Quake.

Ultimately, I then acquire a copy of each and read and re-read them :) I'm mostly interested in the biographic books and technical books, but I'll read anything.

This list of books is publish for other Quake + Book nerds like me, and because maybe someone knows about a book that I missed that can then be added to the list.

### Why?

Because I love Quake and I love books.

### Help

Am I missing a book on Quake?

Do you know about a book that has a chapter on Quake?
