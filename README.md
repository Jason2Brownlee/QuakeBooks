## About

The goal of this project is to identify all books on or that cover Quake.

Book must have at least one chapter on or about Quake, Quake II, or Quake III Arena.

It is inspired by the Doom [List of books](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/List_of_books), but for Quake.

### Why?

Because I love Quake and I love books.

### Where To Get The Books?

Most of the books are out of print.

Secondhand copies can be found on Amazon and similar online resellers.

Many of the books can also be found in digital format elsewhere online, such as the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), [Retromags](https://www.retromags.com/), and [Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.org/).

### Help

Am I missing a book on Quake?

Do you know about a book that has a chapter on Quake?
